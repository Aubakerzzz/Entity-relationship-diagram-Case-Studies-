 These case studies highlight the diverse applications of database management systems in various domains.
 From event management systems for large-scale conventions like NaSCon, to sports leagues like the Pakistan
 Super League (PSL), popular online games like PUBG, and professional networking platforms like LinkedIn,
 each case study demonstrates the importance of effectively organizing and managing data. By designing 
 entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) and implementing relational databases, these systems enable efficient 
 record-keeping, information retrieval, and data analysis. They showcase the critical role of database
 management systems in streamlining operations, enhancing user experiences, and facilitating decision-making
 processes.These case studies serve as valuable examples of real-world scenarios where database management 
 plays a crucial role in organizing, structuring, and analyzing data. By understanding the requirements and
 intricacies of these systems, developers can gain insights into building robust and scalable database
 solutions for a wide range of applications.
